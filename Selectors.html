    <p id="1"><h2>Global Warming</h2>
    Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans over an extended period. This phenomenon is a significant part of climate change, which also includes shifts in weather patterns and other environmental changes
    </p><br>
    <p id="2"><h2>Causes</h2>
    The primary driver of global warming is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, mainly due to human activities: 
    Burning Fossil Fuels: 
    The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂). 
    Deforestation: 
    Trees absorb CO₂, so cutting them down reduces the Earth's capacity to remove these gases from the atmosphere. 
    Industrial Activities and Agriculture: 
    These sectors contribute to the release of potent greenhouse gases like methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). 
    The Greenhouse Effect: 
    These increased GHGs trap heat from solar radiation in the atmosphere, warming the planet. </p>
    <br>
    <p id="3"><h2>Effects</h2>
    The warming of the Earth's surface leads to a range of impacts: 
    Rising Sea Levels: 
    Glaciers and ice sheets melt, contributing to a rise in global sea levels. 
    Extreme Weather Events: 
    There is an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves, as well as changes in precipitation patterns. 
    Ecosystem Disruption: 
    Changes in temperature and climate disrupt ecosystems and biodiversity. 
    Threats to Food and Water Security: Shifts in climate patterns can threaten food supplies and the availability of fresh water.
