        <h1>Climate Change</h1>
    Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution.[3][4] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases.[5] These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.[6]
    Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[7] Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.[8] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[9] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[10] Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[11]
    Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.[12] Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[13] The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century.[14] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[15] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[16] Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.[17][18]

        <h2>Global Warming</h2>
        Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans over an extended period. This phenomenon is a significant part of climate change, which also includes shifts in weather patterns and other environmental changes

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        The primary driver of global warming is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, mainly due to human activities: 
        Burning Fossil Fuels: 
        The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂). 
        Deforestation: 
        Trees absorb CO₂, so cutting them down reduces the Earth's capacity to remove these gases from the atmosphere. 
        Industrial Activities and Agriculture: 
        These sectors contribute to the release of potent greenhouse gases like methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). 
        The Greenhouse Effect: 
        These increased GHGs trap heat from solar radiation in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

        <h2>Effects</h2>
        The warming of the Earth's surface leads to a range of impacts: 
        Rising Sea Levels: 
        Glaciers and ice sheets melt, contributing to a rise in global sea levels. 
        Extreme Weather Events: 
        There is an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves, as well as changes in precipitation patterns. 
        Ecosystem Disruption: 
        Changes in temperature and climate disrupt ecosystems and biodiversity. 
        Threats to Food and Water Security: Shifts in climate patterns can threaten food supplies and the availability of fresh water.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution. Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time.[32] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably.[33][34][35] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased global average surface temperature, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes.[32]
        Climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout Earth's history.[36] Global warming—used as early as 1975[37]—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate.[38] Since the 2000s, usage of climate change has increased.[39] Various scientists, politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and may use the term global heating instead of global warming.[40][41]
